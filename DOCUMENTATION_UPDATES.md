### 4. Game ID Updates

Updated all documentation to reflect current 2024-2025 season game IDs:

| Sport | Game Key | Example Game ID |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| NFL | `nfl` | `449` (2024 season) |
| MLB | `mlb` | `448` (2025 season) |
| NBA | `nba` | `450` (2024-2025 season) |
| NHL | `nhl` | `451` (2024-2025 season) |

**Important Note:** Added guidance to always use sport keys (e.g., `"nfl"`) instead of specific game IDs when querying current season data, as game IDs change annually.

## Verification

All tool counts have been verified against the source code in `src/tools/fantasy-tools.ts`:
- ✅ getTools() method returns exactly 54 tool definitions
- ✅ All 54 tools are documented in API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- ✅ All categories match the implementation

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/ladmin/WebProjects/yahooMcp/README.md`
2. `/Users/ladmin/WebProjects/yahooMcp/QUICKSTART.md`
3. `/Users/ladmin/WebProjects/yahooMcp/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
4. `/Users/ladmin/WebProjects/yahooMcp/MISSING_FEATURES.md`
5. `/Users/ladmin/WebProjects/yahooMcp/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES.md` (new)

## Next Steps

The documentation is now accurate and complete. Future updates should:
1. Verify tool count matches code when adding new tools
2. Update game IDs at the start of each new sports season
3. Keep API_DOCUMENTATION.md in sync with fantasy-tools.ts
4. Update MISSING_FEATURES.md when implementation status changes
